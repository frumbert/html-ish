# html-ish
Simplified markup for Columns, Tabs &amp; Accordions in HTML5(ish).

    <tabs>
        <hello there.>
            I'm a tab.
        </hello>
        <hi*>
            Yes, but I'm the default (selected) tab.
        </hi*>
        <what's up?>
            Did you know that document.querySelector() thinks this is valid markup?
        </what's>
        <it's cool & all good>
            Probably don't want to run this through a validator.
        </it's>
    </tabs>

Did you know you could do this? You can't. But with some javascript hackery, you can!
